# Final_Year_Project_2022-2023

This project was realized as a part of validating the second semester of my second telecommunications engineering scholar year.

With my colleague "MEDAYDI" (Github username), The CI/CD pipeline helped automate the various stages of the development process,
from code compilation to continuous delivery, while ensuring consistent code quality through unit testing and regular checks.
